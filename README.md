These are implementations of the papers I analysed during my Surge project.

ising_model.ipynb is the implemetation of https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7659   (heuristic approach)  (colab - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16gCgFZS57YghmcWqE7KJEK6dIjoFkwB3?authuser=0#scrollTo=iuVu10RXAhYM)

graphlearn.ipynb is the implementation of https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11905  (uses mirror descent)  (colab - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X2smr6-l3HCFYmT6cJ-_w5AlOcGrJXbU#scrollTo=nnkUk-qiqDyQ&uniqifier=3)
